-> Convention: Unix Shell variables will have their names in UPPERCASE
-> Cannot use unset command to variables that are marked readonly.
-> All the conditional expressions should be inside square braces with spaces around them.
    Ex. Wrong X [$a==$b],    Right \/ [ $a == $b ]
-> Logical OR (-o), Logical AND (-a)
-> Single = (checks if the value of two operands are equal or not)
   Double == (same but it's specific to bash)
   -eq (for integer expression only)
-> [ -z $a ] -> checks if zero
   [ -n $a ] -> checks if not zero.
-> " -g " -> checks if file has its set group ID (SGUID) bit set.
   " -u " -> User ID (SUID) bit set
   " -s " -> size greater than 0
   " -e " -> if file exists (even if it's a directory)
-> Looping from 1-10 but incrementing each time by 2 {1..10..2}
-> \v : vertical tab
-> Passing 2 variables to a function Hello()
    : Hello Ashutosh Patel
    : Accessing using $1 and $2 inside the function.
-> ` ` : backticks are used to execute a command in a subshell and capture its output as a string (old way).
   `$(...)`: new way.
-> [ vs [[(advance [) : (supports wildcards as well using =~ )
